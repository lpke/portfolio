# LPDev Portfolio Repository
This is the root folder / app directory for my future replacement portfolio website.<br/>
I'm making the move to Next.js as I learn the ins and outs of the JAM Stack, React, and SSR/Static Rendering.

My current live portfolio was created on the Squarespace Developer Platform and is live at [lpdev.io](https://lpdev.io).
